# iLiveMyLife whitepaper

## Abstract

People more and more realize that email is not a good tool for collaboration and move away to chats like Slack, Discord or even Telegram for managing projects or even companies.  
But those are not ideal either. Yes, some tools have a basic ability to devide communication into different topics but at the end chats become overloaded with messages and useful knowledge is lost in history.

With our solution we want to suggest a more flexible communication model where communication happens at the same time as building documentation into knowledge graph.

## Background

Despite the fact that email remains a popular tool for productive communication, many consider it to be outdated technology, insufficient to use when collaborating among team members. However, moving to the popular chat platforms such as Slack, Discord or even Telegram, also proves to be a poor strategy with regards to the tools lacking some essential productivity and information organizational features. Those tools try to separate chats into different topics but in the end channels/rooms become overloaded with messages while useful information becomes lost in noise without a practical way to resurface it. 
iLiveMyLife helps team members organize information in a variety of self documenting approaches. The main approach is conducted via promotion of the information hierarchy suggested to participants when they start and plan out the project at the high level. In addition, machine learning algorithms help promote and audit informational hierarchies as the project evolves, while suggesting to the participants when their structures can be optimized.

## Solution
Regardless of being a more flexible model of communication compared to most popular messaging platforms we propose to be a platform where people can also earn money by participating in collaboration. While their project is growing in knowledge, this is translated to earning ILML coin by different mechanisms from mining thoughts to being your own coin where value is defined by out of the project acknowledgment though financial transaction like giving you access to “Credit line” wallet staked in different coins.

We are currency agnostic and the value of our currency is defined by transactions on the open market through exchange to other currency. 

The cost of maintenance for our software underneath is defined by the quality of thoughts inside the system. If you are not willing to pay for your thoughts then your thoughts are worth nothing to you. If you see the value in someone else's thoughts - then you should be incentivized to contribute to maintaining and enhancing that knowledge. 


## Why do you think you are better than others?


## Competitve analysis or Related work

Who are competing applications? What are they doing different? Why are you better?



The text below you wrote, I do not understand how is it related to the messaging or MQ service and all discussion we had about Kafka?

## Technology 

Let's call an '**item**' (read as a bold item) a variable representing some information. For simplicity we are going to talk about the textual information down the road unless specified otherwise. But the context of the information is mostly irrelevant.
As you can see, the variable item is defined as a bold item by wrapping the information into markdown ** 'language'.

Let's now introduce another information wrapper on top of the variable item, called {{item}}.

Let’s specify some properties of the {{..}} operation:
* it is an operation of creation of a variable which has a link to the variable {{parent}}
* it is a reference to another variable {{item}}
* it is a data holder which stores all the history of changes for the variable item, let's say it represents a blockchain
* it is a program running by the name of 'item' and handling all the information change happening down the road with variable 'item' and all of variables who knows about the existence of 'item'
